# Customer Sentiment Watchdog - A Dual Dashboard Project

*Team:* Team NueroNet ðŸš€
*Event:* Hackathon Project

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview

The Customer Sentiment Watchdog is a comprehensive, dual-dashboard web application designed for sentiment analysis. Built from scratch for a hackathon, this project provides two distinct views for monitoring and analyzing customer feedback: a high-level, multi-platform overview and a focused, deep-dive analysis tool. The entire application runs on the front-end using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and Tailwind CSS.

## âœ¨ Key Features

This project is split into two interconnected dashboards:

### Dashboard 1: Real-Time Overview (page1.html)

This dashboard provides a "mission control" view for monitoring sentiment across multiple platforms in a simulated real-time environment.

* *Simulated Real-Time Feeds*: The dashboard automatically updates with new comments from six different platforms: Twitter, Amazon, Instagram, Google Playstore, Google, and Reddit.
* *Nuanced Emotion Detection: Each comment is analyzed by a custom JavaScript engine that identifies a wide range of emotions, including **Excitement, Satisfaction, Confusion, Disappointment, Frustration,* and *Anger*.
* *Live Alerts Panel*: Critical negative feedback is automatically flagged and pushed to a dedicated "Alerts" panel, ensuring urgent issues are never missed.
* *Manual Analysis Tool*: Users can input any text to get an instant sentiment analysis.
* *Overall Trend Chart*: A live-updating line chart visualizes the positive vs. negative sentiment trends over time, providing a clear big-picture view.

### Dashboard 2: Advanced Analysis & Star Rating (page2.html)

This dashboard is a specialized tool designed for a deeper, more direct analysis of individual messages, converting sentiment into an actionable star rating.

* *Tone-to-Star Conversion*: The core feature analyzes messages and assigns a 0-5 star rating based on the detected tone.
* *Focused Tone Analysis: The analysis engine uses regular expressions to classify messages into four distinct tones: **Happy, Moderate, Sad,* and *Angry*.
* *Live Bar Chart*: A bar chart updates in real-time to track the total count of each detected tone, offering a clear summary of the overall mood.
* *Message Volume Tracking*: A line chart tracks the total number of messages analyzed over time, visualizing user engagement with the tool.
